# Overview

Under the SRC folder you will find **[api](../src/api/)** and **[data](../src/data/)** which contains the application and data code.

## Cosmos DB, Azure Search and Open AI Components Deployment

The repo uses the [products.csv](../data/AzureSearch/data/products.csv) as sample data. It looks as follows

<img src='/media/01_Productsample.PNG' width='950' height='150'>

Using this sample data a search index is created on the following fields

![SearchIndex](../media/01_SearchIndexStructure.PNG)

Based on the above structure various fields are called to integrate filtering, sorting, vectorization capabilities and dedicate how the search results will look like. This is done using [Search Index](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-an-index), [Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-indexer-overview) & [Vector Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-store)capabilities of Azure AI Search. This is leveraged for creating an [Open AI Embedding](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding)

<img src='/media/01_SearchFields.PNG' width='850' height='550'>

These configurations get called in the [createIndex.py](/src/data/AzureSearch/createIndex.py)
It creates the following resources

1) A Cosmos Endpoint
2) A Cosmos Database with partitioned data
3) A Cosmos Connection String with default Azure Credentials
4) An Azure Search Endpoint
5) An Azure AI Search Index
6) An Open AI Endpoint
7) An Open AI Embedding Skillset
8) A One-time Run of Indexer

The code is executed using a [Default Azure Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-python) from Azure Identity. 

### Step 1
It first creates a Cosmos container, database and a database partition key(In this sample the **id** field is used).
> :bulb: **Tip:** Sample dataset should print the following result:
"Getting Database: catalogDB", "Getting client for container: products"

### Step 2
It then uploads the data in the CSV file to the newly created Cosmos database.
> :bulb: **Tip:**  Sample dataset should print the following result:
"Uploading Data...", "Inserting product ID: {each product ID should get displayed here} to Cosmos DB","Product {each product ID should get displayed here} uploaded to Cosmos DB". It will iterate through all 101 items in the CSV file

### Step 3
The Index definition is created based on the fields mentioned in the config.json file. We also set variables required for [Vectorizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer) and [Semantic Configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-how-to-configure?tabs=portal) based on the configurations mentioned in the config file.
> :bulb: **Tip:**  Sample dataset should print the following result:
"Setting Indexer Variables..."

### Step 4
A service endpoint is created pointing the database container name. It uses the [search service managed identity connection string](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-index-cosmosdb#supported-credentials-and-connection-strings) to connect to CosmosDB
> :bulb: **Tip:**  Sample dataset should print the following result:
"Creating Search Client with Endpoint: <endpointname>", "Data Source created successfully."

### Step 5
Here is where we leverage te variables set in Step 4 and create the AI [Search Index](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-an-index). 
> :bulb: **Tip:**  Sample dataset should print the following result:
"Search Index created successfully"

### Step 6
OpenAIâ€™s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:

- **Search** (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
- **Clustering** (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
- **Recommendations** (where items with related text strings are recommended)
- **Anomaly detection** (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
- **Diversity measurement** (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
- **Classification** (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)
In this step we configure the [OpenAI Embedding Skillset](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding).

> :bulb: **Tip:**  Sample dataset should print the following result:
"Creating OpenAI Embedding Skillset","Creating the Skillset", "Skillset created successfully"

### Step 7
Finally we create the [Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-indexer-overview) and run it.The indexer is used to scan the data from the Cosmos DB and push the data to the Azure AI Search Index.
> :bulb: **Tip:**  Sample dataset should print the following result:
"Creating the indexer.", "Indexer created successfully."
On an initial run, when the index is empty, an indexer will read in all of the data provided in the table or container. On subsequent runs, the indexer can usually detect and retrieve just the data that has changed. Since we are using Azure CosmosDB we have already enabled the change detection. This is to enable the different stages of indexing.

## Workflow

The CosmosDB **catalogDb** database gets created with a sample of 101 files and random images.
This resides under the **products** container within Cosmos DB. Cosmos DB version azure-cosmos==4.7.0

The infrastructure components get deployed with a **Bicep template**.
The **backend web API's** are in **.NET code** which run in the container app. This gets created with secrets which get auto-populated during deployment through the Bicep template.

![ContainerAppSecrets](../media/01_ContainerAppSecrets.PNG)

The spa folder contains the **frontend React code**. This runs as a **static web application**. It has an API connection to the container app. No image search functionality

![ConnectiontoConaitnerApp](../media/01_ConnectionContainerApp.PNG)


The AI search components consists of **Index** that searches the cosmosDB for certain fields and a Semantic configuration for generic searches. 

|![SearchIndex](../media/01_SearchServiceIndex.PNG)| ![SemanticConfig](../media/01_SemanticConfig.PNG)|
| ------ | ---- |

There is also the **Indexer** which shows the date when the CosmosDB was indexed.

**APIM** is public facing. The frontend is reactive in its layout. Furthermore it has paging and filters which let's you perform key value search. It can also cater to interactive search.
